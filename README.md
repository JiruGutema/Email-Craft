# Email Craft

**Email Craft** is a full-stack web application built with **NestJS** (backend) and **NextJS** (frontend) for composing, styling, and sending custom HTML emails directly from your Gmail account. It features secure authentication via Google OAuth, robust JWT-based authorization, and a modern HTML email editor.

The backend uses **Prisma ORM** with PostgreSQL for efficient user and token management, and integrates with the Gmail API to send both plain text and HTML emails. Automatic token refresh ensures uninterrupted access, while custom guards protect sensitive operations.

The frontend provides a rich interface with live HTML editing, syntax highlighting, and preview capabilities. Drafts are automatically cached in the browser, allowing users to resume their work at any time.
